#devember
I, javi, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be learning Rust and trying to do “The world of wumpus”. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise.

I’m gonna learn Rust from the official book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and then try to make the game “The world of wumpus” following this guide about the rules of the game (https://cis.temple.edu/~giorgio/cis587/readings/wumpus.shtml) in ASCII.
